Dear Hiring Manager:\\
\\
I am writing in response to the National Security Agency having visited my college to advertise the Summer
Internship Programs that are available.\\
\\
Currently I am attending Florida Polytechnic University aiming for a Bachelor's of Science
in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity.
So I understand the importance of upholding security principles and maintaining information integrity.\\
\\
Before I had decided on which college to attend, I had seriously considered joining the Army for one of
their cybersecurity programs because I am very patriotic and I've always had a passion for computers.
Now that I am nearing the end of my college education I am still looking for how to give back to my country,
a position at the National Security Agency satisfies both of my passions.\\
\\
Being in my third year of college my classes have advanced my understanding of computer science principles
and mathematics. My favorite class thus far is Applied Cryptography, I think it is fascinating the amount
of improvement that can be seen in previous decades and am excited to learn about the improvements that
can be made on current technology.\\
\\
I believe that both my passion for computers and patriotism makes me an ideal candidate for the Summer
Internship Program. I look forward to learning more about how the National Security Agency protects the
United States from cyber threats.\\
\\
Sincerely,\\
\\\\
Brandon Thompson
