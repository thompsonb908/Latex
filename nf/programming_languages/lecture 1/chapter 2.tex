\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item alphabet - a finite set of symbols, denoted $\Sigma$
    \item letter - an element of an alphabet
    \item word - a finite sequence of letters from the alphabet
    \item $\Lambda$ (empty string) - a word without letters
    \item language - a set of words formed from the alphabet
\end{itemize}

Two words are considered the same if all their letters are the same and in the same order.
There is a difference between the word that has no letters $(\Lambda)$, and the language that has no words $(\Phi)$.
It is not true that $\Lambda$ is a word in the language $\Phi$ since this language has no words at all.
