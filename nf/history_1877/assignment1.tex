	\title{Reconstruction: The 14th Amendment's Significance: Due 1/8}
	\author{Brandon Thompson 5517}
	\maketitle

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the process for amending the Constitution?

		\item The former Confederate states were opposed to giving African-Americans
			full citizenship rights after the war. So how did the 14th Amendment
			get ratified?
		\item At the time it was passed, the 14th Amendment established that African-Americans
			were citizens. But in addition, this amendment profoundly changed American law
			through a doctrine known as incorporation. What is the incorporation doctrine?
		\item Give one example of another Supreme Court case where the 14th Amendment was
			cited in a ruling.
