\textbf{Informative Essay}
\end{center}

	Between 2004 and 2009 almost 40,000 mass layoffs occurred in the US, affecting over
	7 million workers. \autocite{sucher} Technology is advancing at a rapid rate, with
	advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics, your job could soon be
	automated. This paper will cover the ethical implications of replacing large amounts
	of workers with robotic systems. Should employers be allowed to replace capable workers
	with machines? What should be done with the workers who have been replaced?
	
	Automating jobs could be a good thing for the workers, people in the welding profession
	can develop eye, nose and throat irritation as well as pulmonary infections, heart
	disease, and lung and throat cancer as a product of working with hazardous materials.
	\autocite{pham} Replacing these workers with a machine would not only increase production
	for the company, it will reduce health issues caused by welding.
