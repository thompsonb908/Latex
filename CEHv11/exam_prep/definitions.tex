\begin{itemize}
    \item Vulnerability management lifecycle:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Risk assessment: All serious uncertanties that are associated with the system are assessed and prioritized, and remediation is planned to permanently eliminate system flaws.
        \item Remediation: The process of applying fixes on vulnerable systems in order to reduce the impact and severity of vulnerabilities.
        \item Verification: Provides clear visibility into the firm and allows the security team to check whether all the previous phases have been perfectly employed or not.
        \item Monitoring: Organizations need to perform regular monitoring to maintain system security. Continuous monitoring identifies potential threats and any new vulnerabilities.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities.

    \item Network-based Assessment: Discover network resources and map the ports and services running to various areas on the network.
    \item Non-credentialed Assessment: Hacker does not possess any credentials.
    \item Credentialed Assessment: The ethical hacker possesses the credentials of all machines present in the assessed network.
    \item Distributed Assessment: employed by organizations with assets like servers and clients at different locations, involves simultaneously assessing the distributed organization assets, such as client and server applications using appropriate synchronization techniques.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vulnerability Assessment Solutions, Tools and Reports}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Product-Based Solutions: Solutions are installed either on a private or non-routable space or on the internet-addressable portion of an organization's network.
    \item Tree-Based Assessment: the auditor (parent) selects different strategies for each machine or component (child nodes) of the information system. This approach relies on the administrator to provide a starting piece of intelligence and then to start scanning continuously without incorporating any information found at the time of scanning.
    \item Service-Based Solutions: Offered by third parties, such as auditing or security consulting firms. Some solutions are hosted inside the network, while others are hosted outside the network.
    \item Inference-Based Assessment: Scanning starts by building an inventory of the protocols found on the machine.
    \item Depth Assessment Tools: Used to discover and identify previously unknown vulnerabilities in a system. Generally tools such as fuzzers, which provide arbitrary input to a system's interface, are used to identify vulnerabilities to an unstable depth.
    \item Host-Based Vulnerability Assessment Tools: appropriate for servers running various applications, such as the Web, critical files, databases, directories, and remote accesses. These host based scanners can detect high levels of vulnerabilities and provide required information about the fixes (patches)
    \item Scope assessment tools: Scope assessment tools provide an assessment of the security by testing vulnerabilities in the applications and operating system. These tools provide standard controls and a reporting interface that allows the user to select a suitable scan.
    \item Application-Layer Vulnerability Assessment Tools: Designed to sever the needs of all kinds of operating system types and applications. Various resources pose a variety of security threats and are identified by the tools designed for that purpose.
    \item Vulnerability scanning solutions steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Locating nodes: locate live hosts in the target network using various scanning techniques.
        \item Performing service and OS discovery: enumerate the open ports and services along with the operating system on the target systems.
        \item Testing for vulnerabilities: test for vulnerabilities on target nodes.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Tools
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|theHarvester|: used for open-source intelligence gathering and helps to determine a company's external threat landscape on the Internet. Attackers use this tool to perform enumeration on the LinkdIn social networking site to find employees of the target company along with their job titles.
        \item \verb|Qualys VM|: Cloud based service that gives immediate global visibility into where IT systems might be vulnerable to the latest Internet threats and how to protect them. Helps to continuously identify threats and monitor unexpected changes in a netowrk before they turn into breaches.
        \item \verb|Sherlock|: Searches a vast number of social networking sites for a target username.
        \item \verb|Octoparse|: Offers automatic data extraction, scrapes web data without coding and turns web pages into structured data. gathers text, links, image urls and html code.

        \item Target Information: information about the target system's name and address.
        \item Results: A complete scanning report containing subtopics such as target, services, vulnerability, classification, and assessment.
        \item Target: Includes each host's detailed information and contains the following information:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \verb|<Node>| name and address of the host.
            \item \verb|<OS>| Operating system
            \item \verb|<Date>| Date of the test.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Services: Defines the network services by their names and ports.
        \item Classification: Allows the system administrator to obtain additional information about the scan, such as its origin.
        \item Assessment: provides information regarding the scanner's assessment of discovered vulnerabilities.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Hacking}
\subsubsection{System Hacking Concepts}
\subsubsection{Gaining Access (Cracking Passwords and Vulnerability Exploitation)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kerberos authentication: Employs a key distribution center (KDC) that consists of an authentication server (AS) and a ticket-granting server (TGS), and uses "tickets" to prove a user's identity.
    \item Markov-Chain Attack: Attackers gather a password database and split each password entry into two and three character syllables (2-grams and 3-grams); using these character elements, a new alphabet is developed, which is then matched with the existing password database.
    \item PRINCE Attack: A \textbf{PR}obability \textbf{IN}finite \textbf{C}hained \textbf{E}lements (PRINCE) attack is an advanced version of a combinator attack in which, instead of taking inputs from two different dictionaries, attackers use a single input dictionary to build chains of combined words.
    \item Combinator Attack: Attacker combines the entries of the first dictionary with those of the second dictionary. The resultant list of entries can be used to produce full names and compound words.
    \item Fingerprint Attack: The passphrase is broken down into fingerprints consisting of single- and multi- character combinations that a target user might choose as his/her password.
    \item Spiking: Allows attackers to send crafted TCP or UDP packets to the vulnerable server in order to make it crash.
    \item Generate shellcode: Attackers use the msfvenom command to generate the shellcode and inject it into the EIP register to gain shell access to the target vulnerable server.
    \item EIP Register: Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP) register contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.
    \item Fuzzing: Allows the attacker to send large amounts of data to the target server so that it experiences buffer overflow and overwrites the EIP register.
    \item Overwrite the EIP register allows attackers to identify whether the EIP register can be controlled and can be overwritten with malicious shellcode.
    \item Tools
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Factiva: Global news database and licensed content provider. It is a business information and research tool that gets information from licensed and free sources and provides capabilities such as searching, alerting, dissemination, and business information management.
        \item Shodan: Computer search engine that searches the Internet for connected devices (routers, servers, and IoT).
        \item SecurityFocus: database of the recently reported security vulnerabilities.
        \item Maltego: program that can be used to determine the relationship and real-world links between people, groups, organizations, websites, Internet infrastructure and documents.
        \item Infoga: Used for gathering email account information (IP,hostname, country) from different public sources and it checks if the email was leaked using the \verb|haveibeenpwned.com| API.
        \item Splint: Can be used to detect common security vulnerabilities including buffer overflows.
    \end{itemize}
    \item NTLMv2 us a default authentication sceme that performs authentication using a challenge/response strategy. Can be cracked with dictionary or brute force, not rainbow table because NTMLv2 adds a salt value that is exchanged in the messaging, thus it cannot be used in a pass-the-hast attack either.
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Escalating Privileges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Meltdown vulnerability - This is found in all the Intel processors and ARM processors deployed by Apple. This vulnerability leads to tricking a process to access out-of-bounds memory by exploiting CPU optimization mechanisms such as speculative execution.
    \item Dylib hijacking - Allows an attacker to inject a malicious sylib in one of the primary directories and simply load the malicious dylib at runtime.
    \item Spectre Vulnerability - Found in many modern processors such as AMD, ARM, Intel, Samsung and Qualcomm. Leads to tricking a processor to exploit speculative execution to read restricted data. Modern processors implement speculative execution to predict the future and to complete the execution faster.
    \item DLL hijacking - Attacker places a malicious DLL in the application directory; the application will execute the malicious DLL in place of the real DLL.
    \item Application Shimming - Malicious technique on Microsoft Windows in which application shim's are abused to establish persistence, inject DLLs, elevate privileges, and much more. The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Framework can be used to create Shim Database (.sdb) files that are typically used to fix software compatibility issued, however they can instead be abused for nefarious purposes.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Maintaining Access (Executing Applications and Hiding Files)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rootkits
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Boot Loader Level Rootkit: Replaces the original bootloader with the one controlled by a remote attacker.
        \item Hardware/Firmware Rootkit: Hides in hardware devices or platform firmaware that are not inspected for code integrity.
        \item Hypervisor level rootkit: Acts as a hypervisor and modifies the boot sequence of the computer system to load the host operating system as a virtual machine.
        \item Library Level Rootkit: Replaced the original system calls with fake ones to hide information about the attacker.
        \item Application level rootkit: Operate inside the victims computer by replaceing the standard application files (binaries) with rootkits or by modifying behavior of resent applications with patches, injected malicious code, and so on.
        \item Kernel level rootkit: the kernel is the core of the operating system. Kernel level rootkits run in Ring-0 with the highest operating system privileges. These cover backdoors on the computer and are created by writing additional code or by substituting portions of kernel code with modified code via device drivers in Windows or loadable kernel modules in Linux. Of the kit's code contains mistakes or bugs, kernel-level rootkits affect the stability of the system. These have the same privileges of the operating system; hence they are difficult to detect and intercept or subvery the operatings of operating systems.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hiding data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Spread Spectrum Techniques: Communcation signals occupy more bandwidth than required to sent the infomration. The sender increases the band spread by means of code (independent of data), and the reciever uses a synchonized reception with the code to recover the information from the spread spectrum data.
        \item Transform Domain Techniques: Hides information in significant parts of the cover image, such as cropping, compression, and some other image processing areas.
        \item Substitution Techniques: Attacker tried to encode secret information by substituting the insignificant bits with the secret message.
        \item Distortion Techniques: The user implements a sequence of modifications to the cover to obtain a stego-object. The sequence of modifications represents the transformation of a specific message.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Stego-Attacks
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stego-only attack: the steganalyst or attack does not have access to any information except the stego-medium or stego-object. In this attack, the steganalyst must try every possible steganography algorithm and related attack to revoce the hidden information.
        \item Chosen-message attack: The steganalyst uses a known message to generate a stego-object by using various steganography tools to find the the steganography algorithm used to hide information.
        \item Chosen-stego attack: Takes place when the steganalyst knows both the stego-object and steganography tool or algorithm to hide the message.
        \item Chi-square attack: The chi-square method is based on probability analysis to test whether a given stego-object and the original data are the same or not. If the differece between both is nearly zero, then not data are embedded; otherwise, the stego-object includes embedded data inside.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clearing logs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Commands
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|history -c|: useful in clearing the stored history.
        \item \verb|export HISTSIZE=0|: This command disables the BASH shell from saving the history by setting the size of the history file to 0.
        \item \verb|history-w|: This command only deletes the history of the current shell, wheras the command history of other shells remain unaffected.
        \item \verb|shred ~\.bash_history|: This command shreds the history file, making its contents unreadable.
    \end{itemize}
    \item TCP Parameters: Can be used by the attacker to distribute the payload and to create covert channels. Some of the TCP fields where data can be hidden are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item IP Identification field: one character is encapsulated per packet.
        \item TCP acknowledgement number: Uses a bounce server that revieves packets from the victim and sends it to an attacker. Here one hidden character is relayed by the bounce server per packet.
        \item TCP initial sequence number: does not require an established connection between two systems. Here, one hidden character is encapsulated per SYN request and Reset packets.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Clear Online Tracks: Attacker clear online tracks maintained using web history, logs. cookies, cache, downloads, visited time, and other on the target computer, so that victims cannot notice what online activities attackers have performed.
    \item Programs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|Auditpol.exe|: command line utility tool to change Audit Security settings at the category and sub-category levels. Attackers can use AuditPol to enable or disable security auditing on local or remote systems and to adjust the audit criteria for different categories of security events.
        \item \verb|Clear_Event_Viewer_Logs.bat/clearlogs.exe| utility for wiping the logs of a target system.
        \item \verb|SECEVENT.EVT|: Deletes security events
        \item \verb|SYSEVENT.EVT|
        \item \verb|APPEVENT.EVT|
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Malware Threats}
\subsubsection{Malware Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Social Engineering Click-jacking: Inject malware into websites that appear legitimate to trick users into clicking them. When clicked, the malware embedded in the link executes without the knowledeg of the user.
    \item Malvertizing: Embedding malware-laden advertisements in legitimate onlone advertising channels to spread malware on systems of unsuspecting users.
    \item Black hat search Engine Optimization (SEO): also known as unethical SEO uses agressive SEO tactics such as keyword stuffing, inserting doorway pages, page swapping, and adding unrelated keywords to get higher search engine rankings for malware pages.
    \item Compromised Legitimate Websites
    \item Malware Components
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Downloader: Type of trojan that downloads other malware or malicious code files from the internet on to the PC or device. Attackers usually install downloaders when they first gain access to a system.
        \item Crypters: software that encrypts the original binary code of the .exe file. Crypters hide viruses, spyware, keyloggers, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and others to make them undetectable to anti-viruses.
        \item Obfuscator: Obfuscation means to make code harder to understand or read, generally for privacy or security concerns. Converts a straightforward program into one that works the same way but is much harder to understand. It is a program to conceal the malicious code of malware via various techniques, thus making it hard for security mechanisms to detect or remove it.
        \item Payload: Part of the malware that performs desired activity when activated. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{APT Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Trojan Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ports for trojans:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Port 80: Necurs, NetWire, Ismdoor, Poison Ivy, Executer, Codered, APT 18, APT 19, APT 32, BBSRAT, Calisto, Carbanak, Carbon, Comnie, Empire, FIN7, InvisiMole, Lazarus Group, MirageFox, Mis-Type, Misdat, Mivast, MoonWind, Night Dragon, POWERSTATS, RedLeaves, S-Type, Threat Group-3390, UBoatRAT.
        \item Port 20/22/80/442: Emotet
        \item Port 8080: Zeus, APT 37, Comnie, EvilGrab, FELIXROOT, FIN7, HTTPBrowser, Lazarus Group, Magic Hound, OceanSalt, S-Type, Shamoon, TYPEFRAME, Volgmer.
        \item Port 11000: Senna Spy
    \end{itemize}
    \item Banking trojan - steals credentials before they are encrypted by the system and sends them to the attacker.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item TAN Grapper: Transaction Authentication Number (TAN) is a single-use password for authenticating online banking transactions. Banking trojans intercept valid TANs entered by users and replace them with random numbers. Subsiquently, the attacker misuses the intercepted TAN with the target's login details.
        \item HTML Injection: Trojan creates fake form fields on e-banking pages, therby enabling the attacker to collect the target's account details, credit card number, date of birth, etc. The attacker can use this information to impersonate the target and compromise his/her account.
        \item Form Grabber: Type of malware that captures a target's sensitive data such as IDs and passwords, from a web browser form or page. It is an advanced method for collecting the target's Internet banking infomration. It analyses POST requests and responses to the victims browser. it compromises the scramble pad authentication and intercepts the scramble pad input as the user enters his/her Customer Number and Personal Access Code.
        \item Covert Credential Grabber: This malware remains dormant until the user performs an online financial transaction. It works covertly to replicate itself on the computer and edits the registry entries each time the computer is started. The trojan also searches the cookie files that had been stored on the computer while browsing financial websites. Once the user attempts to make an online transaction, the Trojan covertly steals the login credentials and transmits them to the hacker.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Covert Channel: methods attackers use to hide data in an undetectable protocol. Rely on tunneling, which enables one protocol to transmit ofver the other. Any process or a bit of data can be a covert channel. Attackers can use covert channels to install backdoors on the target machine.
    \item Asymmetric routing: Routing technique where packets flowing through TCP connections travel through different routes to different directions.
    \item Tools:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trojan.Gen: generic detection for many individual but varied Trojans for which specific definitions have not been created.
        \item Senna Spy Trojan Generator: Trojan that comer hidden in malicious programs. Once you install the source program, the trojan attempts to gain 'root' access without knowledge.
        \item Win32.Trojan.BAT: System destructive trojan program. It will crash the system by deleting files.
        \item DarkHorse Trojan Maker: Used to create user-specific trojans by selecting from various options.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Trojans
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mirai: a self-propagating botnet that infects poorly protected internet devices (IoT). Uses Telnet port 23 or 2323 to find devices that are using their factory default username and password. Mirai is used to coordinate and mount a DDoS attack against a chosen victim.
        \item Netwire: type of RAT
        \item Theef: type of RAT
        \item Kedi RAT: type of RAT
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Virus and Worm Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Virus lifecycle Stages
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Replication: Virus replicates for a period within the target system and then spreads itself.
        \item Launch: Virus is activated when the user performs specific actions such as running an infected program.
        \item Detection: Virus is identified as a threat infecting the target system.
        \item Execution of the damage routine: User installs antivirus updates and eliminate the virus threats.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Types of viruses
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sparse infector virus: infect less often and try to minimize their probability of discovery. Only infect on a certain condition or those files whose lengths fall within a narrow range.
        \item Metamorphic Viruses: Programmed such that they rewrite themselves completely each time they infect a new exe.
        \item Cavity Viruses: Some programs have empty spaces in them. Cavity viruses, or space fillers, overwrite a part of the host file with a constant (usually nulls), without increasing the length of the file while preserving its functionality. Maintaining a constant file size when infecting allows the vius to avoid detection.
        \item Polymorphic Viruses: Infect a file with an encrypted copy of a polymorphic code already decoded by a decryption module. Polymorphic viruses modify their code for each replication to avoid detection.
        \item Tunneling Viruses: Tries to hide from antivirus by actively altering and corrupting the service call interrupts while running. The virus code replaces the requests to perform operations with respect to these service call interrupts. They state false information to hide their presence from antivirus programs.
        \item Macro Viruses: Infect Microsoft Word or similar applications by automatically performing a sequence of actions after triggering an application. Mose macro viruses are written using the macro language Visual Basic or Applications (VBA), and they infect templates or convert infected documents into template files while maintaining their appearance of common document files.
        \item File Viruses: Infect files executed or interpreted in the system, such as COM, EXE, SYS, OVL, OBJ, PRG, MNU, and BAT files. File viruses can be direct-action (non-resident) or memory-resident-viruses.
        \item System or Boot Sector Viruses: Most common targets for a virus are the system sectors, which include the mastor boot record (MBR) and the DOS boot record system sectors. An OS executes code in these areas while booting. Every disk has some sort of system sector. MBRs are the most virus prone zones because if the MBR is corrupted, all data will be lost. The DOS boot sector also executes during system booting. This is a crucial point of attack for viruses.
    \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
    \item DNS Poisoning Techniques: sniff DNS traffic of a target network. An attacker can obtain the ID of the DNS request by sniffing and can send a malicious reply to the sender before the actual DNS server.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Intranet DNS spoofing: An attacker can perform an intranet DNS spoofing attack on a switched LAN with the help of the ARP poisoning technique. To perform this attack, the attacker must be connected to the LAN and be able to sniff the traffic or packets. An attacker who succeeds in sniffing the ID of the DNS request from the intranet can send a malicious reply to the sender before the actual DNS server.
        \item Internet DNS spoofing: Attackers perform Internet DNS spoofing with the help of Trojans when the victim's system connects to the Internet. It is an MITM attack in which the attacker changes the primary DNS entries of the victim's computer.
        \item Proxy server DNS poisoning: In the proxy server DNS poisoning technique, the attacker sets up a proxy server on the attacker's system. The attacker also configures a fraudulent DNS and makes its IP address a primary DNS entry in the proxy server.
        \item DNS cache poisoning: Attackers target this DNS cache and make changes or add entries to the DNS cache. If the DNS resolver cannot validate that the DNS responses have come from an authoritative source, it will cache the incorrect entries locally and serve them to users who make the same request.
    \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
    \item Sniffing Attacks
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ARP Spoofing: A method of attacking an Ethernet LAN. When a legitimate user initiates a session with another user in the same layer 2 broadcast domain, the switch broadcasts and ARP request using the recipient's IP address, while the sender waits for the recipient to respond with a MAC address.
        \item ARP Poisoning: With the help of ARP poisoning, an attacker can use fake ARP messages to divert all communications between two machines so that all traffic redirects via the attacker's PC.
        \item ARP Method: Sends a non-broadcast ARP to all nodes in the network. The node that runs in promiscuous mode on the netwrok will cache the local ARP address. Then it will broadcast a ping message on the network with the local IP address but a different MAC address. In this case, onlt the node that has the MAC address (cached eariler) will be able to respond to your braodcast ping request.
        \item Ping method: To detect a sniffer on a network, identify the system on the network running in promiscuous mode. The ping method is useful in detecting a system that runs in promiscuous mode, which in turn helps detect sniffers installed on the network.s
    \end{itemize}

    \item Pretexting: fraudsters may pose as executives from financial institutions, telephone companiesm and so on who rely on "smooth talking" and win the trust of an individual to reveal sensitive information.
    \item Pharming: an advanced form of phishing in which attackers modify DNS protocol and redirects the connection between the IP address and its target server.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Insider threats and Identity Theft}

    \item Tax Identity Theft: This type of identity theft occurs when perpetrator steals the victim's Social Security Number or SSN in order to file fraudulent tax returns and obtain fraudulent tax refunds. It creates difficulties for the victim in accessing the legitimate tax refunds and results in a loss of funds.
    \item Identity cloning and concealment: This is a type of identity theft which encompasses all forms of identity theft where the perpetrators attempt to impersonate someone else in order to simply hide their identity. These perpetrators could be illegal immigrants or those hiding from creditors or simply want to become “anonymous” due to some other reasons.
    \item Synthetic identity theft: This is one of the most sophisticated types of identity theft where the perpetrator obtains information from different victims to create a new identity. Firstly, he steals a Social Security Number or SSN and uses it with a combination of fake names, date of birth, address and other details required for creating new identity. The perpetrator uses this new identity to open new accounts, loans, credit cards, phones, other goods and services.
    \item Social identity theft: This is another most common type of identity theft where the perpetrator steals victim's Social Security Number or SSN in order to derive various benefits

\subsection{Denial-of-Service}
\subsubsection{DoS/DDoS Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item DoS attakcs have various forms and target various services. The attacks may cause the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consumption of resources
        \item consumption of bandwidth, disk space, CPU time, or data structures.
        \item Actual physical destruction or alteration of network components
        \item Destruction of programming and files in a computer system.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques and Tools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Back chaining Propogation: In this technique, the attacker places an attack toolkit on their own system, and a copy of the attack toolkit is transferred to a newly discovered vulnerable system. The attack tools installed on the attacking machine use some special methods to accept a connection from the compromised system and then transfer a file containing the attack tools to it.
    \item Autonomous Propagation: In autonomous propagation, the attacking host itself transfers the attack toolkit to a newly discovered vulnerable system, exactly at the time it breaks into that system.
    \item Central Source Propagation: In this technique, the attacker places an attack toolkit on a central source and a copy of the attack toolkit is transferred to a newly discovered vulnerable system. Once the attacker finds a vulnerable machine, they instruct the central source to transfer a copy of the attack toolkit to the newly compromised machine, on which attack tools are automatically installed under management by a scripting mechanism.
    \item Spyware Propagation: As its name implies, spyware is installed without user knowledge or consent, and this can be accomplished by “piggybacking” the spyware onto other applications.
    \item Tools:
    \begin{itemize}

        \item NetVisor: Desktop and child monitoring spyware that comes with an unparalleled task recording feature set that in secret records everything employees do on your network.
        \item Fritzing: assists attackers in designing electronic diagrams and circuits.
        \item Stormwall PRO: Filtering mitigation of all existing types of DDoS attacks on network, transport and session layers as well as application layer for HTTP(S)/Websocket traffic.
        \item Suphacap: a Z-Wave sniffer, is a hardware tool used to sniff traffic generated by smart devices connected in the network. It allows attackers to perform real-time monitoring and capturing of packets from all Z-Wave networks.
        \item KillerBee: Python based framework and tool set for exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 netowrk.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Application-level flood attacks result in the loss of services of a particular network resource. Examples include email, network resources, temporary ceasing of applications and services, and so on. By using this attack, attackers exploit weaknesses in programming source code to prevent the application from processing legitimate requests. In this type of attack, an attacker tries to exploit the vulnerabilities in application layer protocol or in the application itself to prevent the access of the application to the legitimate user.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Flood web applications to legitimate user traffic (GET/POST)
        \item Disrupt service to a specific system or person, for example, blocking a user's access by repeating invalid login attempts.
        \item Jam the application database connectino by crafting malicious SQL queries.
        \item Slowloris
        \item OS Vulnerabilities.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Protocol Attack: includes SYN floods, fragmented packets, ping of death, smurf DDos, teardrop, land, and other attacks.
    \item Volume-based attack: UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed packet floods.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{DoS/DDoS Protection Tools and Countermeasures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Activity profiling: Performed based on the average packet flow rate for network flow, which consists of consecutive packets with similar packt header information.
    \item Wavelet-Based Signal Analysis: The wavelet analysis technique analyzes network traffic in terms of spectral components. it divides incoming signals into various frequencies and analyzes different frequency components separately.
    \item Sequential Change-Point Detection: Change-Point detection algorithms isolate changes in network traffic statistics and in the traffic flow rate caused by attacks. Uses cumulative sum algorithms.
    \item Absorbing the attack: Is a DoS/DDoS countermeasure strategy, in which additional capacity is used to absorb an attack, which requires preplanning and additional resources.
    \item Cisco IPS Source and reputation filtering: reputation services help in determining if an IP or service is a source of threat.
    \item Black Hole Filtering: refers to discarded packets at the routing level.
    \item RFC 3704 Filtering: a basic access control list (ACL) filter, which limits the impact of DDoS attacks by blocking traffic with spoofed addresses.
    \item DDoS Prevention Offering from ISP or DDoS service: Enable IP Source Gurad (in CISCO) or similar features in other routers to filter traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database or IP source bindings, preventing a bot from succeeding with spoofed packets.
    \item Ingress Filtering protects against flooding attacks that originate from valid prefixes (IP addresses).
    \item Egress filtering scans the headers of IP packets going out of the network.
    \item TCP intercept: In this mode the router intercepts the SYN packets sent by the clients to the server and matches with an extended access list. If there is a match, then on behalf of the destination server, the intercept software establishes a connection with the client. Similarly, the intercept software also setablishes a connection with the destination server on behalf of the client. Once the two half connections are established, the intercept software combines them transparently. Prevents the attempts of fake connection from reaching the server. Acts as a mediator between the server and the client throughout the connection.
    \item MAC address filtering allows you to define a list of devices and only allows those devices on your network.
    \item Tools
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DDoS-Guard: online service to protect against DDoS

\subsection{Session Hijacking}
\subsubsection{Session Hijacking Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Application Level Session Hijacking}"
\begin{itemize}
    \item Man in the Middle Attack: A MITM attack is used to intrude into an exiting connection between systems and to intercept messages being transmitted. In this attack, attacks use different techniques and split a TCP connectin into two: client-to-attacker and attacker-to-server connections.
    \item Fragmentation Attack: These attacks destroy a victim's ability to reassemble fragmented packets by flooding it with TCP or UDP fragments, resulting in reduced performance. The attacker sends a large number of fragmented (1500+ byte) packets to a target web server with a relatively small packet rate.
    \item Man in the Browser Attack: Similar to a MITM attack. The difference between the two is that a MITB attack uses a Trojan horse to intercept and mainpulate calls between a browser and its security mechanisms or libraries. An attack positions a previously installed Trojan between the browser and its security mechanism, and the Trojan can modify web pages and transaction content or insert additional transactions. All of the Trojan's activities are invisible to both the user and the web application.
    \item Client-side Attack: Target vulnerabilities in client applications that interact with a malicious server or process malicious data. Depending on the nature of vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit an application by sending an email with a malicious ling or otherwise tricking a user into visiting a malicious website. 
    \item XXS: enables attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    \item Trojans: can change the proxy settings in the user's browser to send all sessions through an attacker's machine.
    \item Malicious JavaScript Codes: An attacker can embed in a web page a malicious script that does not generate any warning but captures session tokens in the background and sends them to the attacker.
    \item Session donation Attack: An attacker donates his/her own session identifier (SID) to the target user. The attacker first obtains a valid SID by logging into a service and later feeds the same SID to the target user. This SID links a target user back to the attacker's account page without any information to the victim.
    \item Proxy servers: An attacker lures the victim to click on a bogus link, which looks legitimate but redirects the user to the attackers server. The attacker forwards the request to the legitimate server on behalf of the victim and servers as a proxy for the entire transaction. The attacker then captures the session's information during the interaction of the legitimate server and user.
    \item CRIME Atatck: Compression Ratio Info-Leak Made Easy (CRIME) is a client side attack that exploits the vulnerabilities present in the data compression feature of protocols, such as SSL/TLS, SPDY, and HTTPS. Attackers hijack the session by decrypting secret session cookies. The authentication information obtained from the session cookies is used to establish a new session with the web application.
    \item Forbidden attack: Type of MITM used to hijack HTTPS sessions. It exploits the reuse of cryptographic nonce during the TLS handshake. After hijacking the GTTPS session, the attacker inject malicious code and forged content that prompts the victim to disclose sensitive information, such as bank account numbers, passwords, and social security numbers.
    \item Session replay attack: An attacker captures the authentication token of a user by listening to a conversation between the user and the server and reiterates the authentication request to the server with the captured authentication token to gain unauthorized access to the server.
    \item Application Level Hijacking: gaining control over HTTP's user session by obtaining the session IDs.
    \item Network Level hijacking: interception of packets during transmission in a TCP and UDP session between a server and client communication. attacks transport an internet level protocols
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Network Level Session Hijacking}
\begin{itemize}
    \item IP Spoofing: Source routed packets: useful in gaining unauthorized access to a computer with the help of a truseted host's IP address. This type of hijacking allows attackers to create their own acceptable packets to insert into the TCP session. First, the attacker spoofs the trusted host's IP address so that the server managing a session with the host accepts the packets from the attacker. The packets are source routed, so the sender specifies the path for packets from the source to the destination IP. Using this source-routing technique, attackers can fool the server into thinking that it is communicating with the user.
    \item Blind Hijacking: A hacker can inject malicious data or commands into the intercepted communications in a TCP session, even if the victim disables source routing. Here, an attacker correctly guesses the next ISN of a computer attempting to establish a connection; the attacker sends malicious data or a command, such as password setting to allow access from another location on the network, but the attacker can never see the response. To be able to see the response, a MITM attack works much better.
    \item TCP/IP hijacking: an attacker intercepts an established connection between two communicating parties using spoofed packets, and then pretends to be one of them. In this approach, the attacker uses spoofed packets to redirect the TCP traffic to his/her own machine. Once this is successful, the victim's connection hangs and the attacker is able to communicate with the host's machine on behalf of the victim.
    \item UDP hijacking
    \item RST Hijacking
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Session Hijacking Tools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Burp Suite: Burp Suite is a web security testing tool that can hijack session IDs in established sessions. The Sequencer tool in Burp Suite tests the randomness of session tokens. With this tool, an attacker can predict the next possible session ID token and use that to take over a valid session
    \item Vega: a free and open-source web security scanner and web security testing platform for testing the security of web applications. Vega helps you to find and validate SQL injection, XXS, inadvertently disclosed sensitive information and other vulnerabilities.
    \item PortQry: Reports the port status of TCP and UDP ports on a selected target. Attackers can use PortQry tool to perform TFTP enumeration. This utility reports the port status of target TCP and UDP ports on a local or remote computer.
    \item DroidSheep: Used for session hijacking on Android devices connected to a common wireless network. It obtains the session ID of active users on the WiFi network and uses it to access a website as an authorized user. A DroidSheep user can easily observe the activities of authorized users on websites. It can also hijack social accounts by obtaining the session ID.
    \item ShellPhish: A phishing tool used to phish user credentials from various social networking platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkdIn. Also displays to victim system's public IP address, browser information, hostname, geolocation, and other information.

It is a collection of various tools delivered “as a service” to help security professionals, product managers, IT shops, enterprises, and start-ups to acquire more details about their potential visitors, users, customers, and threat actors.
    \item FaceNiff: FaceNiff is an Android app that allows a user to sniff and intercept web-session profiles over the WiFi network that the user's mobile device is connected to. Although FaceNiff can hijack sessions only when the WiFi network does not use the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), it works on any private network, including open, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access-pre-shared key (WPA-PSK), and WPA2-PSK networks.
    \item sslstrip: Sslstrip tool is exploiting user behavior and if a user does not type https:// in front of the link, and the website has redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, it will intercept HTTP 302 redirection and send the user exactly what the user asked for, i.e. HTTPsite

        \item BetterCAP: ARP poisoning
        \item MITMf: ARP poisoning
        \item Cain an Abel: ARP poisoning.
    \end{itemize}
    \item IPsec: used to secure VPN sessions
    \item IPsec Components:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item IPsec Driver: Software that performs protocol-level functions required to encrypt and decrypt packets.
        \item Internet Key Exchange (IKE): A protocol that produces security keys for IPsec and other protocols.
        \item Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP): Software that allows two computers to communicate by encrypting the data exchanged between them.
        \item Oakley: A protocol that uses Diffie-Hellman algorithm to create a master key and a key that is specific to each session in IPsec data transfer.
        \item IPsec Policy Agent:
    \end{itemize}
    \item IPsec architecture:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Authentication Header (AH): Offers integrity and data origin authentication, with optional anti-replay featues.
        \item Encapsulating Security payload (ESP): Offers all the services offered by AH as well as confidentiality.
        \item IPsec Domain of Interpretation (DOI): Defines the payload formats, types of exchange, and naming conventions for security information such as cryptographic algorithms or security policies. IPsec DOI instantiates ISAKMP for use with IP when IP uses ISAKMP to negotiate security associations.
        \item IPsec Policies: useful in providing network security. Defines when and how to secure data, as well as security methods to use at different levels in the network. One can configure IPsec policies to meet the security requirements of a system, domain, site, organizational unit and so on.
    \end{itemize}
    \item HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): a web security policy that protects HTTPS websites against MITM attacks. The HSTS policy helps web servers force web browsers to interact with them using HTTPS. With the HSTS policy, all insecure HTTP connections are automatically converted into HTTPS connections. This policy ensures that all the communication between a web server and a web browser is encrypted and that all responses that are delivered and recieved originate from an authenticated server.
    \item HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP): A trust on first use (TOFU) technique used in an HTTP header that allows a web client to associate a specific public key certificate with a prticular server to minimize the risk of MITM attacks based on fraudulent certificates. In TLS sessions, to verify the authenticity of a servers public key, the public key is enclosed in an X.509 digital certificate, which is signed by a certificate authority (CA).
    \item WEP/WPA Encryption: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wireless Protected Access (WPA) are wireless protocols that are intended to protect the traffic that is sent and received by users over a wireless network. The implementation of these protocols can thwart the attempts of unwanted users to connect to the network. A weak encryption mechanism enables attackers to brute force credentials and enter the target network to perform an MITM attack.
    \item Token Binding: When a user logs into a web application, a cookie with a session ID, called a token, is generated. The user utilizes this random token to send requests to the server and access resources. An attacker can impersonate the user and hijack the connection by capturing and reusing a valid session ID. Token binding protects client-server communication against session hijacking attacks. The client creates a public-private key pair for every connection to a remote server.

\subsection{Evading IDS, Firewalls, and Honeypots}
\subsubsection{IDS, IPS, Firewall and Honeypot Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Signature Recognition: also known as misuse detection, tries to identify events that indicate an abuse of a system or network resource. This technique involves first creating models of possible intrusions and then comparing these models with incoming events to make a detection decision.
    \item Protocol Anomaly Detection: Protocol anomaly detection depends on the anomalies specific to a protocol. It identifies particular flaws between how vendors deploy the TCP/IP protocol. Protocols designs according to RFC specifications, which dictate standard handshakes to permit universal communication. The protocol anomaly detector can identify new attacks.
    \item Anomaly Detection: Anomaly detection, or “not-use detection,” differs from the signature-recognition model. Anomaly detection consists of a database of anomalies. An anomaly can be detected when an event occurs outside the tolerance threshold of normal traffic. Therefore, any deviation from regular use is an attack. Anomaly detection detects the intrusion based on the fixed behavioral characteristics of the users and components in a computer system. Creating a model of normal use is the most challenging task in creating an anomaly detector.
    \item Obfuscating: Obfuscating is an IDS evasion technique used by attackers to encode the attack packet payload in such a way that the destination host can only decode the packet but not the IDS. An attacker manipulates the path referenced in the signature to fool the HIDS. Using the Unicode character, an attacker could encode attack packets that the IDS would not recognize, but an IIS web server would decode.
    \item Bastion Host: The bastion host is designed for defending the network against attacks. It acts as a mediator between inside and outside networks. A bastion host is a computer system designed and configured to protect network resources from attacks. Traffic entering or leaving the network passes through the firewall
    \item File System Intrusion: By observing system files, the presence of an intrusion can be identified. System files record the activities of the system.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If you find new, unknown files / programs on youe system. Unexplained modification in file size are also an indication of an attack.
        \item You can identify unfamiliar file names in directories, including executable files with strange extensions and double extensions.
        \item Missing files are also a sign of a probable intrusion/attack.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Network Intrusions: general indications of network intrusions include the following
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A sudden increas in bandwidth consumption
        \item repeated probes of the available services on your machine.
        \item connection requests from IPs other than those in the network range, which imply that an unauthorized user (intruder) is attempting to connect to the network.
        \item Repeated login attempts from remote hosts.
        \item A sudden influx of log data, which could indicate attempts at DoS attakcs, bandwidth consumption, and DDoS attacks.
    \end{itemize}
    \item System Intrusions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item sudden changes in logs such as short or incomplete logs.
        \item Unusually slow system performance.
        \item Missing logs or logs with incorrect permissions or ownership.
        \item Unusual graphic displays or text messages.
        \item Gaps in system accounting.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Signature recognition: is an IDS intrusion detection method, also known as misuse detection, tries to identify events that indicate an abuse of a system or network resource.
    \item Honeynet: Very effective in determining the entire capabilities of adversaries and is mostly deployed in an isolated virutal environment along with a combination of vulnerable servers?
    \item Packet information:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Direction: Used to check whether the packet is entering or leaving the private network.
        \item Interface: Used to check whether the packet is coming from an unreliable zone.
        \item TCP flag bits: Used to check whether the packet has SYN, ACK, or other bits set for the connection to be made.
        \item Source IP address: Userd to check whether the packet is coming from a valid source. The information about the source IP address can be found from the IP header of the packet.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Circuit-level gateway firewall: The firewall is only monitoring TCP handshaking of packets at the session layer of the OSI model
    \item Stateful Multilayer Instection firewall: They filter packets at the network layer, to determine whether session packets are legitimate, and evaluate the contents of packets at the application layer. With the use of stateful packet filtering, you can overcome the limitation of packet firewalls that can only filter on IP address, port, protocol, and so on. This multilayer firewall can perform deep packet inspection.
    \item Application-level Firewall: Application-based proxy firewalls concentrate on the application layer rather than just the packets. The need for application-level firewall arises when huge amount of voice, video, and collaborative traffic are accessed at data-link layer and network layer utilized for unauthorized access to internal and external networks. Useful to filter specific commands such as \verb|http:post|
    \item Packet filtering firewall:  A packet filtering firewall investigates each individual packet passing through it and makes a decision whether to pass the packet or drop it. It works at the Internet protocol (IP) layer of the TCP/IP model. Packet filter–based firewalls concentrate on individual packets, analyze their header information, and determine which way they need to be directed.

Also, it filters out an annoying and potentially dangerous email.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Evading IDS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Invalid RST Packets: The TCP uses 16-bit checksums for error checking of the header and data and to ensure that communication is reliable. It adds a checksum to every transmitted segment that is checked at the receiving end. When a checksum differs from the checksum expected by the receiving host, the TCP drops the packet at the receiver's end. The TCP also uses an RST packet to end two-way communications. Attackers can use this feature to elude detection by sending RST packets with an invalid checksum.
    \item Fragmentation attack: Fragmentation can be used as an attack vector when fragmentation timeouts vary between the IDS and the host. Through the process of fragmenting and reassembling, attackers can send malicious packets over the network to exploit and attack systems.
    \item Obfuscating: It is an IDS evasion technique used by attackers to encode the attack packet payload in such a way that the destination host can only decode the packet but not the IDS. An attacker manipulates the path referenced in the signature to fool the HIDS. Using Unicode characters, an attacker can encode attack packets that the IDS would not recognize but which an IIS web server can decode
    \item Insertion Attack: Insertion is the process by which the attacker confuses the IDS by forcing it to read invalid packets (i.e., the system may not accept the packet addressed to it). An IDS blindly trusts and accepts a packet that an end system rejects. If a packet is malformed or if it does not reach its actual destination, the packet is invalid. If the IDS reads an invalid packet, it gets confused. An attacker exploits this condition and inserts data into the IDS.
    \item Flooding: an IDS evasion technique used by an attacker to send a huge amount of unnecessary traffic to produce noise or fake traffic. If the IDS does not analyze the noise traffic, the true attack traffic goes undetected.
    \item Overlapping fragments:
    \item Encryption:
    \item Polymorphic shellcode:  an attacker use an existing buffer-overflow exploit and set the “return” memory address on the overflowed stack to the entrance point of the decryption code.
    \item Session Splicing: Attacker splits the attack traffic into an excessive number of packets sudh that no single packet triggers the IDS.
\end{itemize}

Super network tunnel integrates SocksCap function along with  bidirectional HTTP tunneling and remote control to simplify the configuration.
        \item SecurePipes: SSH tunneling tool
        \item Traffic IQ Professional: Traffic IQ Professional is a tool that audits and validates the behavior of security devices by generating the standard application traffic or attack traffic between two virtual machines. This tool is generally used by security personnel for assessing, auditing, and testing the behavioral characteristics of any non-proxy packet-filtering device, which can include application firewalls, IDS, IPS, routers, switches, etc. However, as this tool can generate custom attack traffic, it is extensively employed by attackers to bypass the installed perimeter devices in the target network.
        \item Colasoft Packet Builder: Colasoft Packet Builder: Colasoft Packet Builder is used to create custom network packets and fragmenting packets. Attackers use this tool to create custom malicious packets and fragment them such that firewalls cannot detect them. They can create custom network packets such as Ethernet Packet, ARP Packet, IP Packet, TCP Packet, and UDP Packet. Security professionals use this tool to check your network's protection against attacks and intruders.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Firewalking is a method of collecting information about remote netowrks behind firewalls. It is a technique that uses TTL values to determine gateway ACL filters and map networks by analyzing the IP packet response.
    \item Banner Grabbing: A simple method of fingerprinting that helps in detecting the vendor of a firewall and the firmware version. It identifies the service running on the system. Attackers use banner grabbing to fingerprint services and thus discover the services running on firewall.
    \item IP address spoofing: a hijacking technique in which an attacker masquerades as a trusted host to conceal his identity, spoof a website, hijack browsers, or gain unauthorized access to a network. In IP spoofing, the attacker creates IP packets by using a forged IP address and gains access to the system or network without authorization.
    \item Tiny fragments: Attackers create tiny fragments of outgoing packets, forcing some of the TCP packet's header information to go into the next fragment. The IDS filter rules that specify patterns will not match with the fragmented packets owing to the broken header information. The attack will succeed if the filtering router examines 
    \item ACK Tunneling method: Allows tunneling a backdoor application with TCP packets with the ACK bit set. The ACK bit is used to acknowledge the reciept of a packet. Some firewalls do not check packets with the ACK bit set because ACK bits are supposed to be used in response to legitimate traffic.
    \item source routing: using this technique, the sender of the packet designates the route (partially or entirely) that a packet should take through the network such that the designated route should bypass the firewall node. Thus the attack can evade firewall restrictions.
    \item Anonymizer: Anonymizer's VPN routes all traffic through an encrypted tunnel directly from your laptop to secure and harden servers and networks. It then masks the real IP address to ensure complete and continuous anonymity for all online activities.

    \item Data Tampering: alters or deletes the data of a web server and replaces the data with malware.
    \item Web Proxy: A proxy server is located between the web client and web server. Owing to the placement of web proxies, all requests from clients are passed on to the web server through the web proxies. They are used to prevent IP blocking and maintain anonymity
    \item PHP: application layer and is used to generate dynamic web content.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Web Server Attacks}

\subsection{Web Applications}
\subsubsection{Web App Concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web Application Layers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Client/Presentation Layer: includes all physical devices present on the client side, such as laptops, smartphones, and computers. These devices feature operating systems and compatible browsers, which enable users to send requests for required web applications. The user requests a website by entering a URL in the browser, and the request travels to the web server. The web server then responds to the request and fetches the requested data; the application finally displays this response in the browser in the form of a web page.
        \item Business Logic Layer: consists of two layers: the web-server logic layer and the business logic layer. The business logic layer includes the functional logic of the web application, which is implemented using technologies such as .NET, Java, and “middleware”. It defines the flow of data, according to which the developer builds the application using programming languages. It stores the application data and integrates legacy applications with the latest functionality of the application.
        \item Web-Server Logic Layer: contains various components such as a firewall, an HTTP request parser, a proxy caching server, an authentication and login handler, a resource handler, and a hardware component, e.g., a server. The firewall offers security to the content, the HTTP request parser handles requests coming from clients and forwards responses to them, and the resource handler is capable of handling multiple requests simultaneously.
        \item Database Layer: consists of cloud services, a B2B layer that holds all the commercial transactions, and a database server that supplies an organization's production data in a structured form (e.g., MS SQL Server, MySQL server).
    \end{itemize}
    \item SOAP Messages: Simple Object Access Protocol. Application communication protocol. Format for sending and recieving messages. Platform independent, based on XML.
    \item UDDI: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) is a directory service that lists all the services available.
    \item WSDL: Web Services Description Language is an XML-based language that describes and traces web services.
    \item WS-Security: Web Services Security (WS-Security) plays an important role in securing web services. It is an extension of SOAP and aims to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of SOAP messages as well as to authenticate users.
    \item WS-Policy: WS-Policy is a specification that allows web services to use XML to advertise their policies (on security, quality of service, etc.) and for web service consumers to specify their policy requirements.
    \item Publish: During this operation, service descriptions are published to allow the requester to discover the services.
    \item Bind: During this operation, the requester calls and establishes communication with the services during run time, using binding data inside the service descriptions to locate and invoke the services.
    \item Find: During this operation, the requester tries to obtain the service descriptions. This operation can be processed in two different phases: obtaining the service interface description at development time and obtain the binding and location description calls at run time.
    \item Service: It is a software module offered by the service provider over the Internet. It communicates with the requesters. At times, it can also serve as a requester, invoking other services in its implementation
    
       
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Web App Threats}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SQL injection: injection of malicious SQL queries into user input forms.
    \item LDAP injection involves the injection of malicious LDAP statements.
    \item Shell injection: the attacker tries to craft an input string to gain shell access to a web server.
    \item Command Injection: injection of malicious HTML code or command through a web application. In command injection attacks, a hacker alters the content of the web page by using HTML code and by identifying the form fields that lack valid constraints.
    \item Cross-Site Scripting: In cross-site scripting, attackers bypass client-ID security mechanisms and gain access privileges, and then inject malicious scripts into specific webpages. These malicious scripts can even rewrite HTML website content.
    \item Sensitive data exposure: caused by flaws in insecure cryptographic storage and information leakage
    \item Clickjacking:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Complete Transparent overlay: In this technique, the trasnparent, legitimate page or tool page is overlaid on the previously designed malicious page. Then, it is loaded into an invisible iframe and the higher z-index is assigned for positioning it on top.
        \item Hidden Overlay: Attacker creates an iframe of 1x1 pixels contianing malicious content placed secretly under the mouse cursor. When the user clicks on this cursor, it will be registered on the malicious page although the malicious content is concealed by the cursor.
        \item Click Event Dropping: Can completely hide a malicious page behind a legitimate page. It can also be used to set the CSS pointer-events proptery of the top to none. This can cause click events to "drop" through the legitimate masked page and registers only the malicious page.
        \item Rapid Content Replacement: In this technique, the targeted controls are covered by opaque overlays that are removed only for a moment for registering a click. An attacker using this technique needs to accurately predict the time taken by the victim to click on the web page.
        \item Cropping: Only the selected controls from the transparent page are overlaid. This technique depends on the goal of the attack and may involve masking buttons with hyperlinks and text labels with false information, changing the button labels with wrong commands, and completely covering the legitimate page with misleading information while exposing only one original button.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Timing Attacks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Direct Timing Attack: Carried out by measureing the appoximate time taken by the server to process a POST request to deduce the existence of a username.
        \item Cross-site Timing Attack: Attackers send crafted request packets to the website using JavaScript.
        \item Browser-Based Timing Attack: Attackers take advantage of side-channel leaks of browser to estimate the time taken by the browser to process the requested resources. Attackers can abuse different browser functionalities to launch further attacks such as video parsing attacks and chace storage timing attacks.
        \item Cache Storage Timing Attack: The cache API interface (used to load, fetch, and delete any responses) offers complete cache (memory) to the developers. Loading resources in the disk takes some amount of time based on the resource size. If attackers can estimate the time taken by the browser to perform this task, then can measure the corresponding response size.
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Web App Hacking Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tools:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Halberd: Halberd can identify the real IP address of load balancers. When organizations implement load balancers, their real IP address is hidden behind a virtual IP address.
        \item WAFW00F: Allows one to identify and fingerprint WAFs protecting a website.
        \item Professional Toolset: A DNS interrogation tool that provides information about the locations and types of servers. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Evade XSS filters: Allows an attacker to inject unusual characters into HTML code to bypass client-side controls.
    \item Verbose Failure Message: In a typical login system, the user enters two fields, namely username and password. In some cases, an application will ask for additional information. If the user is trying to log in and fails, it implies that at least one field was incorrect. This provides grounds for an attacker to exploit the application.
    \item Cookie Poisoning: It is a type of parameter tampering attack in which the attacker modifies the cookie contents to draw unauthorized information about a user and thus perform identity theft.
    \item Bypass SAML-based SSO: Attackers take advantage of signature misconfigurations, session expiry timeouts, session replays, misdirected SAML messages, etc., to bypass SAML-based SSO authentication.
    \item Local File Inclusion: LFI vulnerabilities enable attackers to add their own files on a server via a web browser. An LFI vulnerability occurs when an application adds files without proper validation of inputs, thereby enabling the attacker to modify the input and embed path traversal characters
    \item File Fingerprinting: File fingerprinting is a process of computing the hash value for a given binary code to identify and track data across a network.
    \item Security Misconfiguration: By exploiting misconfiguration vulnerabilities like unvalidated inputs, parameter/form tampering, improper error handling, insufficient transport layer protection, etc., attackers gain unauthorized access to default accounts, can read unused pages, can read/write unprotected files and directories, etc.
    \item Hash Stealing: Replaces the value of the Data Source parameter with that of a Rogue Microsoft SQL Server and sets the values of username, data source, and integrated security.
    \item Port Scanning: Try to connect to different ports by changing the value and seeing the error messages obtained.
    \item Hijacking Web Credentials: Try to connect to the database using the web application system account instead of a user-provided set of credentials.
    \item Connection Pool DoS: Attackers examine the connection pooling settings of the target application, construct a large malicious SQL query, and run multiple queries simultaneously to consume all the connections in the connection pool, causing database queries to fail for legitimate users.
    \item Request Forgery Attack: In a request forgery attack, attackers exploit the trust of a website or web application on a user's browser. The attack works by including a link on a page, which takes the user to an authenticated website.
    \item Frame Injection: When scripts do not validate their input, attackers inject code through frames. This affects all the browsers and scripts that do not validate untrusted input. These vulnerabilities occur in HTML pages with frames. Another reason for this vulnerability is that web browsers support frame editing.
    \item Session Fixation: Session fixation helps attackers hijack valid user sessions. They authenticate themselves using a known session ID and then use the known session ID to hijack a user-validated session. Thus, attackers trick users and access a genuine web server using an existing session ID value.
    \item ActiveX Attacks: Attackers lure victims via email or via a link that is constructed such that the loopholes of remote execution code become accessible, allowing the attackers to obtain access privileges equal to those of authorized users.
    \item Session prediction: It focuses on predicting session ID values that allow the attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism of an application. By analyzing and understanding the session ID generation process, the attacker can predict a valid session ID value and gain access to the application.
    \item Session brute-forcing: An attacker brute-forces the session ID of a target user and uses it to log in as a legitimate user and gain access to the application.
    \item Session poisoning: It allows an attacker to inject malicious content, modify the user's online experience, and obtain unauthorized information.
    \item Cross-Site Request Forgery: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), also known as a one-click attack, occurs when a hacker instructs a user's web browser to send a request to the vulnerable website through a malicious web page.
    \item Burp Suite built-in tools:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Intercepting proxy for inspecting and modifying traffic between your browser and the target application.
        \item Application-aware spider for crawling content and functionality.
        \item Sequencer tool for testing the randomness of session tokens.
        \item Intruder tool for performing customized attacks to find and exploit unusual vulnerabilities.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Connection String Parameter Pollution (CSPP) specifically exploits the semicolon delimited database connection strings that are constructed dynamically based on the user inputs from web applications. So, injecting parameters into a connection string using semicolons as a separator is performed for a CSPP attack.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Web API, Webhooks and Web Shell}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web Service APIs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SOAP API: SOAP is a web-based communication protocol that enables interactions between applications running on different platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, etc., via XML and HTTP. SOAP-based APIs are programmed to generate, recover, modify, and erase different logs such as profiles, credentials, and business leads.
        \item RESTful API: RESTful API is a RESTful service that is designed using REST principles and HTTP communication protocols. RESTful is a collection of resources that use HTTP methods such as PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE. RESTful API is also designed to make applications independent to improve the overall performance, visibility, scalability, reliability, and portability of an application.\\
        Features:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cacheable: The client should save responses (representations) in the cache. This feature can enhance API performance
            \item Uniform Interface: Resources must be specifically and independently recognized via a single URL by employing basic protocol methods such as PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE, and it should be possible to modify a resource
            \item Stateless: The client end stores the state of the session; the server is restricted to save data during the request processing
            \item Code on Demand: An optional feature where the server can also provide temporary executable code to the client, through which the client's functionality can be customized
        \end{itemize}
        \item XML-RPC: Extensible Markup Language - Remote Procedure Call (XML-RPC) is a communication protocol that uses a specific XML format to transfer data, whereas SOAP uses proprietary XML to transfer data. It is simpler than SOAP and uses less bandwidth to transfer data.
        \item JSON-RPC: JavaScript Object Notation - Remote Procedure Call (JSON-RPC) is a communication protocol that serves in the same way as XML-RPC but uses the JSON format instead of XML to transfer data.
        \item Webhooks: Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callback or push APIs that are raised based on events triggered, such as receiving a comment on a post or pushing code to the registry. Webhooks allow applications to update other applications with the latest information
    \end{itemize}
    \item Parameters
    \begin{itemize}
        \item response\_type: Code used for informing the server which permissions to execute.
        \item redirect\_uri: URI where the authorization server redirects the user agent when the authorization code is provided.
        \item scope: Defines the level of access to the application
        \item State: Opaque value used for security implementations. The value is also used for maintinaing the state between requests and callback.
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
    \item CSRF on Authorization Response: The attacker performs a CSRF attack to connect a face account on the provider with the victim's account on the client side. This attack exploits a third request related to authorization code grant.
    \item Attack on 'redirect\_uri': While registering, the domain is usually specified by the client and only those "redirect\_uri" on the specific domain are permitted. If an attacker can identify vulnerabilities such as XSS on a web page on the client domain, he/she can exploit them to capture authorization code.
    \item Attack on 'Connect' request: Most sites enable users to access other websites such as LinkdIn, Instagram, and Twitter, via OAuth. An attacker can exploit requests to connect one site to another, i.e., when the user hits the "login with or Connect" button. Then, he or she can gain illegal access to the client-side user/victims account by connecting his/her account to the provider's website.
    \item Access Token Reusage: OAuth requires access tokens for individual clients. It ensures that these tokens saved on the authorization server are mapped to relevant scopes and time expiry. Access token provided for "clientA" can work for "ClientB". Attackers exploit this feature to perform attacks on clients that allow grants implicitly.
    \item API security risks:\\
    \includegraphics{exam_prep/API Security Risks.png}
    \item Fuzzing: Fuzzing: Attackers use the fuzzing technique to repeatedly send some random input to the target API to generate error messages that reveal critical information. To perform fuzzing, attackers use automated scripts that send numerous requests with varying combinations of input parameters. Attackers use tools such as Fuzzapi to perform fuzzing on the target API
    \item Invalid Input Attacks: In some scenarios, fuzzing is difficult to perform due to its structure. In such cases, attackers will give invalid inputs to the API, such as sending text in place of numbers, sending numbers in place of text, sending a greater number of characters than expected, and sending null characters, etc., to extract sensitive information from unexpected system behavior and error messages. At the same time, attackers also manipulate the HTTP headers and values targeting both API logic and the HTTP protocol.
    \item Malicious Input Attacks: In the attack discussed above, attackers try to retrieve sensitive information from unexpected system behavior or error messages. A more dangerous attack is where the attackers inject malicious input directly to target both the API and its hosting infrastructure. To perform this attack, attackers employ malicious message parsers using XML.
    \item Login/Credential Stuffing Attacks: Attackers often target login and validating systems because attacks on these systems are difficult to detect and stop using typical API security solutions. Attackers perform login attacks or credential stuffing attacks to exploit password reuse across multiple platforms. Most users use the same passwords to access different web services
    \item API Vulnerabilities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enumerated Resources:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Design flaws can cause serious vulnerability, disclosing information through unauthenticated public API
            \item Allows attackers to guess user IDs easily, compromising the security of the user data.
        \end{itemize}
        \item RBAC Pivilege Escalation: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Privilege escalation is a common vulnerability present in APIs having role-based access control (RBAC) where changes to endpoints are made without proper attention.
            \item Allow attackers to gain access to users' sensitive information.
        \end{itemize}
        \item No ABAC Validation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No proper attribute-based access control (ABAC) validation allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to API objects or perform actions such as viewing, updating, or deleting.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Buisness Logic Flaws:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Many APIs come with vulnerabilities in buisness logic.
            \item Allows attackers to exploit legitimate workflows for malicious purposes.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

        \item Inspect popular websites
        \item Use browser blug-ins that block HTTP redirects
        \item Disable third-party content such as advertizing services, which track user activities.
        \item Make sure to hide online activities with a VPN and enable the browser's private browsing feature.
        \item Make sure to run the web browser in a virtual environment to limit access to local system.

        \item Perform input and output encoding
        \item Use a safe API that avoids use of the interpreter entirely
        \item Structure requests so that all supplied parameters are treated as data rather than potentially executable content
        \item Use parameterized SQL queries
        \item Use modular shell disassociation from the kernel
        \item Use built-in library functions and avoid calling OS commands directly
    \end{itemize}
    \item countermeasures to defend broken authentication and session management attacks include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use SSL for all authenticated parts of the application
        \item Verify whether all the users' identities and credentials are stored in a hashed form
        \item Never submit session data as part of a GET, POST
        \item Apply pass phrasing with at least five random words
        \item Limit the login attempts and lock the account for a specific period after a certain number of failed attempts
        \item Use a secure platform session manager to generate long random session identifiers for secure session development
        \item Make sure to check weak passwords against a list of the top bad passwords
    \end{itemize}
    \item Countermeasures to defend against broken access control:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perform access control checks before redirecting the authorized user to the requested resource
        \item Avoid using insecure IDs to prevent the attacker from guessing them
        \item Implement a session timeout mechanism
        \item Limit file permissions to authorized users to avoid misuse
        \item Avoid client-side caching mechanisms
        \item Remove session tokens on the server side on user logout
        \item Ensure that minimum privileges are assigned to users to perform only essential actions
        \item Enforce access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cookies flagged as secure are only transmitted over HTTPS
    \item Fuzz testing: Web application Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a black box testing method. It is quality checking and assurance technique used to identify coding errors and security loopholes in web applications. Huge amounts of random data called "fuzz" is generated by the fuzz testing tools (fuzzers) and used against the target web application to discover vulnerabilities that can be exploited by various attacks.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mutation-based: current data samples create new test data and the new test data again mutates to generate further random data. This type of testin starts with a valid sample and keeps mutating until the target is reached.
        \item Protocol-Based: protocol fuzzer send forged packets to the target application that is to be tested
        \item Generation-Based
    \end{itemize}
